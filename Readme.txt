Setting up 

We have decided to use VMware workstation player to demonstrate our project. To set up the project, unzip the file until the capstone-project-3900-h10a-cggds folder is present. Then, follow these steps: 

cd into capstone / backend 

In terminal: sudo apt update 

In terminal: sudo apt install python3-pip 

In terminal: pip3 install –r requirements.txt 

Open a new tab in terminal and cd into capstone / frontend 

In terminal: rm –rf node_modules 

In terminal: sudo apt install npm 

In terminal: sudo npm install -g npm@6.14.4 

In terminal: npm install 

This completes the setting up to run the project. Keep both tabs (one in capstone/frontend, other in capstone/backend) open. 

 

Running 

To run our project, first ensure that the backend and frontend tabs are still open. Then follow these steps to start: 

Open the backend tab, and type in terminal: python3 app.py. Do not close this tab 

Open the frontend tab and type in terminal: npm start. Do not close this tab 

After these 2 commands are typed, a browser should open, and we will be greeted at the landing / home page. From here, refer to the user manual section above to navigate the website.

Card verification during payment  

Purchasing an item from cart requires card verification. It does not retain card information and it does not charge the card. If you do not wish to use your own card, please use https://developers.bluesnap.com/docs/test-credit-cards to obtain a fake credit card. Ensure that the expiry date has not expired.
