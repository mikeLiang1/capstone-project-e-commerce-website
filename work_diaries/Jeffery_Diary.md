# Project Weekly Diary

## Week 1
We formed a group of 5 (CGGDS). We assigned Colin Hon as the scrum master. We created the Jira and Github accounts and decided on the E-commerce recommendation system as our group project. We came up with 5 functionalities without any novelties so far and split it up so that each member had to come up with user stories and acceptance criteria for their functionality.

## Week 2
I wrote the user stories and acceptance criteria for the search functionality. We also had a standup meeting so that we could check each user story and acceptance criteria and give feedback to on another. We also came up with 3 other functionalities including the 2 novelties. We started to split up the project proposal and make a start in which l was responsible for writing the background and research about another company in the market and find their weaknesses.

## Week 3
We were almost done with our project proposal and checked with Cristian if our 2 novelties were novel enough. I made some adjustments on the user stories and acceptance criteria after receiving feedback from my peers. We also added our user stories onto Jira. I also was responsible for managing the sprint dates throughout the project. I researched on some npm packages that we could use for our project such as react-credit-cards.

## Week 4
Our group finalised our project proposal by checking everything one last time. We went to the backlog and started to add user stories into sprint 1. We split up the work according to frontend and backend and focused on implementing the minimum viable product. Jeming and I were responsible on working on the frontend where l worked on the Explore Page, Products Page, and Edit Products Page. We collobarated with the backend team quite often so that they could see what sort of information we needed and vice versa.

## Week 5
We were near completion for Sprint 1 and just needed to connect some pages to the react router as well as tidy up a few bugs. I also introduced Cookies onto the frontend which allowed us to access important information such as user tokens much easier and faster. I did some backend testing by using Postman to see if the fetches worked. 

## Week 6
We added user stories into sprint 2 and split them up the same way as before. I was responsible for implementing the swipe survey for the frontend and backend as well as changing the alerts to popups so that the website would continue running when an error occured. I had to research a bit for the backend as l did not have much experience with the backend using python.

## Week 7
I moved onto Sprint 3 since I finished my tasks in sprint 2. I worked on improving the frontend look for the swipe survey and improved the credit card which now does not let users complete their purchase if any of their details are wrong. (name, card number, cvc, expiry date) We had another meeting where we did a dry run together to see if we could find any bugs and errors.

## Week 8
I added protected routes to some routes as a security feature. For example, when a user tried to add products by adding /addproduct to the route, there would be an authorisation error and a 403 error would be shown.

## Week 9
Our group had a meeting for Retrospective B. We also allocated tasks that needed to be completed for Sprint 4, as well as tasks
that needed to be done for the final project report. I fixed some more bugs on the frontend for example sometimes the swipe survey would return undefined which would cause and error. I started to work on the implementation challenges for the swipe survey in the report.

## Week 10
We worked on finalising our demo, our project, and ensuring our software quality was up to standards. I set up a final test run on 17/11 to ensure that everyone knew which functionalities they would be presenting and ensuring that the order was as logical as possible. We made sure that the backend worked fine as some user accounts had illegal items such as null products which could bug the website out. I finished the implementation challenges for swipe survey, uploading an image, and the recommendation system.
