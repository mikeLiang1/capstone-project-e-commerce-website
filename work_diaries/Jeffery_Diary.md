## Week 1
We formed a group of 5 (CGGDS). We assigned Colin Hon as the scrum master. We created the Jira and Github accounts and decided on the E-commerce recommendation system as our group project. We came up with 5 functionalities without any novelties so far and split it up so that each member had to come up with user stories and acceptance criteria for their functionality.
