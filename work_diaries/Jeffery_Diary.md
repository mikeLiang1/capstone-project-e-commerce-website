## Week 1
We formed a group of 5 (CGGDS). We assigned Colin Hon as the scrum master. We created the Jira and Github accounts and decided on the E-commerce recommendation system as our group project. We came up with 5 functionalities without any novelties so far and split it up so that each member had to come up with user stories and acceptance criteria for their functionality.

## Week 2
I wrote the user stories and acceptance criteria for the search functionality. We also had a standup meeting so that we could check each user story and acceptance criteria and give feedback to on another. We also came up with 3 other functionalities including the 2 novelties. We started to split up the project proposal and make a start in which l was responsible for writing the background and research about another company in the market and find their weaknesses.

## Week 3
We were almost done with our project proposal and checked with Cristian if our 2 novelties were novel enough. I made some adjustments on the user stories and acceptance criteria after receiving feedback from my peers.
