# Project Weekly Diary

## Week 1
Formed our team with Mike, Jeffery, Jeming and Yeji. During the first tutorial I was assigned as Scrum Master, we set a date to have weekly standups other than tutorial period and decided that we would be working on the E-Commerce Website with Recommendation System as our project.

## Week 2
At our standup, we worked through the 8 functionalities that we would be working on and split up each functionality and assigned every team member with user stories to complete and write acceptance criteria for. I was assigned to the admin functionality and completed our user stories in time for review on Thursday

## Week 3
Leading up to the project proposal, my role was to complete the background research and software architecture component of the proposal. We consolidated our user stories together and I emailed the tutor for feedback. I got some useful feedback such as being more specific with our functionalities to avoid any ambiguities. After the submission of the proposal, I began researching into technologies that we could use for the backend as our team was less experienced in backend development. I found technologies such as Firebase and Flask to be very useful for our project.

## Week 4
I worked together with Mike and Yeji to draft up a plan for the backend including the routes and methods that we would have. I then worked on the accounts portion of the backend which included using Firebase Authentication. We set up the Jira to Github integration during the tutorial.

## Week 5
As the frontend portion of our Sprint 1 made up a significant part of the workload, I took on the mystery box frontend and completed it with help from Mike and Yeji. As I had used Firebase, I handled the image upload functionality for adding products.
