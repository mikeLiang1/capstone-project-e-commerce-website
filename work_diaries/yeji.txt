Week 1
Group formed with Mike, Colin, Jeming and Jeffery.
Created Jira accounts and connected my existing GitHub account to the project repository.
Chose E-Commerce Recommender System to be our group project.
Brainstormed what functionalities the system can have and distributed who’s writing the user stories of which functionality.
The group came up with two novelty functions: chatbot and custom products.

Week 2
I wrote user stories and acceptance criteria for review function.
Since none of mobile responsibility, feature to have custom products and chatbot don’t get counted towards novelty functions,
new novelty function mystery box was proposed.
Standup was held on Saturday to further discuss on the format of user stories and splitting parts of proposal document.
Jeming and Mike started working on Figma.
Jeffery, Colin and I were assigned to research on the information that could go into the ‘background’ part of the proposal.

Week 3
I researched JB Hi-Fi's problem for backgrounds and wrote analysed results into the proposal.
Had standup session on Tuesday to split works for proposals since some tasks weren't still assigned.
According to the Christian’s feedback on our user stories, we modified the user stories.
User stories and Figma had to be adjusted to match with each other. Finalised user stories were put on Jira.
I researched on the types of possible external actors and wrote who the external actors would be for our E-Commerce system. 

Wk4
Proposal was submitted on Monday. Splitted tasks for the system.
I was assigned to do backend for products. Firebase was selected to be used for database system.
Using Firebase, I finished HTTP methods that can be used for products database.

Wk5
Since I found errors on the structure of product's data, I had to debug it.
Image field inside product's data got modified to store the download link of the image inside the Firebase storage.
Added number of actual products on the Firebase so that team members working on frontend could use them.
Helped Jeffery by styling the add product page to look more similar to the one on Figma.
After progressive demo, tasks for sprint2 were splitted. I would do backend and frontend for product reviews.
